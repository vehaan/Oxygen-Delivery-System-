# Oxygen-Delivery-System-
A simple oxygen delivery system which supplies oxygen cylinders to the hospitals, by prioritizing using some conditions, using Travelling Salesman Problem

The Travelling Salesman Problem (often
called TSP) is a classic algorithmic problem in the fieldof
computer science and operations research. It is focused
on optimization. In this context better solution often
means a solution that is cheaper. TSP is a mathematical
problem. It is most easily expressed as a graph describing
the locations of a set of nodes.
In Operations Research, the Travelling Salesman
Problem (TSP) lies at the heart of several distribution
management problems and has thus received much
attention in the last thirty years. The fact that the TSP
and many of its extensions are NP-hard means that in
practice, exact solutions will be obtained for only modest
problem sizes. Much effort has been devoted recently to
the derivation of optimal solutions for problems of
realistic dimensions and characteristics. There have been
many algorithms introduced to grant time competent
solutions for the problem, both exact and approximate.
The objective of this project is to optimize delivering
of oxygen cylinder at n randomly chosen hospitals in the
city of Chennai. This problem is otherwise called the
Travelling Salesman Problem(TSP). The Traveling
Salesman Problem includes a salesman who must make a
tour through various points utilizing the briefest way
possible. In this problem the total travelling distance of
few hospitals is minimized. The distance matrix of n
hospitals is taken as input and a basic code is written
to find optimal solutions. The tour is to be begun
from a given point and after completing the tour the
Travelling Salesman has to return to the starting point.
